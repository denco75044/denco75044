- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @denco75044

Today is Saturday, June 5, 2021.  I am an embedded applications engineer at Texas Instruments supporting the MSP430 Family of 16-bit MCUs.  I develop a ton of example code for customers as well as examples that are posted on the TI Resource Explorer https://dev.ti.com/tirex.  

- ðŸŒ± I want to learn how to use GIT.
